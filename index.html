    <h1 class="bodytext">I grew up in Northern New Jersey as the youngest of four. I played baseball and basketball and ran cross county as a kid and enjoyed that very much.  I even ran cross country in college and did well with that also. I rode my bike, played stick ball or wiffle ball with friends, went fishing and swimming and loved trick or treating with friends at Halloween. I in later adult years lived on my own in New Jersey, and even in Florida and Maryland as well. I have visited a bunch of cool places around the world and met a lot of interesting people. I know I can be an asset to your artistic team. </h1>

        <h1 class="bodytext"> Miracle is a 2004 American sports film directed by Gavin O'Connor and written by Eric Guggenheim. It is about the U.S. men's ice hockey team, whose gold medal victory in the 1980 Winter Olympics over the heavily favored seasoned Soviet team was dubbed the "Miracle on Ice". Kurt Russell stars as head coach Herb Brooks with Patricia Clarkson and Noah Emmerich in supporting roles.<span class="span3"> (From Wikipedia)</span></h1>

        <h1 class="bodytext">Even though I am a casual Hockey Fan <span class="span3">(Go Washington Capitals, Stanley Cup Winners in 2018! üòÄ üèí)</span>, this is my favorite movie I do believe. If someone says to me, what are your favorite movies? I will mention Miracle first for sure. It was such an inspirational true story from 1980 as I was nine and still remember the USA Team winning.  Plus I am a big fan of Kurt Russell so that helps too! </h1>

      <H1 class="mainheaderTitle">Barney Miller</H1>

        <h1 class="bodytext">Barney Miller was an American sitcom television series set in a New York City Police Department police station on East 6th Street in Greenwich Village (Lower Manhattan). The series was broadcast on ABC from January 23, 1975, to May 20, 1982. <span class="span3"> (From Wikipedia)</span> A few years ago, I bought the entire series at a local Walmart and binge watched the entire series (Eight Seasons) as it took 2 winter months to complete after work and on days off. I enjoyed every moment of it as it reminded me of being back with my dad as we watched it live together when I was a little kid. (Actually, from like 1979 to 1982 my dad and I watched it together.) </h1>

        <H1 class="mainheaderTitle">Styx</H1>
      
  
          <h1 class="bodytext"> My first ever Rock Concert I saw in person was on June 30, 1983 in Virginia. It was at the then Norfolk Scope Convention Hall in Norfolk. The band was Styx. <span class="span3">(my original ticket stub above from that concert.) </span> It was the "Kilroy was Here" Tour and I went with my parents and my older brother and sister.  In those days they had General Admission seating which meant you were allowed to "upgrade" your ticket by running up to the stage as fast as you could to beat the other fans who wanted to get as close as possible too. My older brother and sister and I were next to the band by the front middle part of the stage and watched the entire show with total delight. <span class="span3"> I was 13!!! üòç </span> The Mr. Roboto song and performance was awesome to me as it transitioned from the short opening movie <span class="span3"> (about reopening the Paradise Theater) </span> to the songs being now sung as part of the regular concert! Mr. Roboto by Dennis DeYoung was the opening song as it followed with that cool theme of Dennis DeYoung and Tommy Shaw as freedom fighters <span class="span3"> (like the Star Wars movies of that day) </span>  fighting to keep Rock N Roll alive! James "J.Y." Young was the "bad guy" in this storyline. A great experience! My brother even high-fived Tommy Shaw during the concert as Tommy was rocking out playing guitar and reaching out to the fans during one song!<span class="span3"> Wow!!!!! üòâ</span></h1>

          <hr>

          <h1 class="bodytext">Even though today the band has mixed feelings about this show <span class="span3"> (they broke up and split into two, the Tommy Shaw/"J.Y." side vs the Dennis DeYoung side, now with two different perspectives on how things went...),</span> it will always remain as a highlight musically in my life because it made me love them as a group even more! Yes, from this concert I saw in person! In my humble opinion, a lot of kids like me, I was 13, became Styx fans from these tour songs and how they showcased it to the public on stage. I agree with Dennis DeYoung on this, but I respect the hell out of Tommy Shaw and James "J.Y." Young (in general) also as they weren't giant fans of this type of show! They just wanted to play Rock N Roll and not do themed concerts which was very popular in those days which Dennis DeYoung wanted to do and liked. I guess we all will agree to disagree! There were many reasons why they broke up. This I believe was one example of it, but their music will live forever!</h1>

          <H1 class="mainheaderTitle">Meet the Band</H1>

          <h1 class="bodytext">Band members were Dennis DeYoung, Tommy Shaw (from 1975), James "J.Y." Young, and brothers Chuck and John Panozzo.<span class="span3"> (pictured above)</span> </h1>


  

          <H1 class="mainheaderTitle">About the Band Styx</H1>

          <h1 class="bodytext">Styx is an American rock band formed in Chicago, Illinois, in 1972. They are known for blending melodic hard rock guitar with acoustic guitar, synthesizers mixed with acoustic piano, upbeat tracks with power ballads, and incorporating elements of international musical theatre. The band established themselves with a progressive rock sound during the 1970s, and began to incorporate pop rock and soft rock elements in the 1980s. <span class="span3"> (From Wikipedia)</span> </h1>
